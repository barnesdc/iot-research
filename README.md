## Abstract Idea
- Utilize NodeRed + MQTT + Raspberry Pi 3 to interface with micro-controllers and sensors
to track simulate and track human movement inside a smart home.
- Research affordances and gain further understanding of how it plays a part

## Tasks:
- set up  / configure Rasperberry Pi 3
  - set up adafruit PiTFTPlus 3.5" touch screen
  - Resource (1)
- configure MQTT broker on Raspberry Pi3
  - Resource (2.(a/b))
- configure Node RED on Raspberry Pi4
  - Resource (3)
